Here's a `README.md` for your script:


# Tor Hidden Service Setup

This Python script sets up a Tor hidden service using the `stem` library. The script launches a Tor process, creates a hidden service, and then outputs the `.onion` address for accessing the service.

## Requirements

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `stem` library (Tor Controller Library)
- Tor (installed and running)

To install the required Python libraries, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install stem
```

### Installing Tor

If you don't have Tor installed, you can follow the official [Tor installation guide](https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-unix.html) based on your operating system.

## How It Works

1. **Starts the Tor process:** The script launches Tor using the `stem.process.launch_tor_with_config` method with a configuration to set up a hidden service.
   
2. **Creates a Hidden Service:** The hidden service is created at the directory `/tmp/hidden_service`, and it's exposed on port `80` (or any other service you configure).

3. **Fetches Onion Address:** Once the service is set up, the script reads the generated `.onion` address from the `hostname` file in the hidden service directory.

4. **Output:** It prints the hidden service's `.onion` address to the console.

5. **Stops Tor:** The script waits for user input and shuts down the Tor process gracefully when the user presses Enter or a KeyboardInterrupt is raised.

## Usage

1. **Run the script**:

    ```bash
    python tor_hidden_service.py
    ```

2. **Output**:
    After running the script, you'll see an output similar to:

    ```
    Your Tor hidden service is available at: http://<your_onion_address>.onion
    ```

3. **Stopping the Tor process**:
    Press Enter to stop the Tor process, or simply send a `KeyboardInterrupt` (Ctrl+C) to terminate it.

## Example

```
$ python tor_hidden_service.py
Your Tor hidden service is available at: http://xyz123abc456.onion
Press Enter to stop Tor...
Shutting down...
```

## Notes

- The hidden service is created temporarily in `/tmp/hidden_service`. Ensure you have permission to write to this directory or modify the path as needed.
- You can modify the configuration options for the Tor process, such as changing the `SocksPort`, `HiddenServiceDir`, or `HiddenServicePort` values.
